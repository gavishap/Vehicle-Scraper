Vehicle-Scraper
Vehicle-Scraper is a Python-based web scraping application designed to extract vehicle listing information from a specific website. The extracted data is stored and organized for further processing or analysis.

Key Features
Web Scraping: The application uses Selenium, a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and automating browser tasks. The presence of chromedriver.exe and geckodriver.log indicates the use of Chrome and Firefox drivers for Selenium.

Data Extraction: The application likely targets specific HTML elements during the scraping process, as suggested by Element.py and elements.json.

Data Organization: The scraped data is organized into 'posted' and 'unposted' categories within the vehicle_listings/ directory, as indicated by the Lister.py file.

Testing: The application includes a testing script (test.py), ensuring the reliability and robustness of the scraping process.

Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language used in the project.
Selenium: A framework for testing web applications, used here for automating browser tasks.
JSON: Used for storing and transporting data (as seen in accounts.json and elements.json).
